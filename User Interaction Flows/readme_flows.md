These flows were designed iteratively through multiple rounds of discussions. 
The final flow is Flow 5.  
### Description


Users can anytime move back to the main menu by typing 0, which is the same as what they would do on IVR. Unlike in previous flows, images are received before the corresponding audio/video so that the email is triggered only once when the second media file is received. The benefit is that the interface can be operated universally by people of all literacy levels, including an illiterate person as the users are not dependent on typing anything. The choice for language would be Hindi but written in English characters (English is used in this document for ease). Another feature to increase user engagement is- whenever a user sent a contact number, the WhatsApp bot would return the links for the stories submitted by that user. Additionally, it adds the option for moderators to submit stories with tags. This specifically solves for the need of distinguishing between the submissions from users versus moderators, which was a major issue in previous designs. The key words 'moderator on' and 'moderator off' are used to allow moderators to switch modes between moderator and user mode in a covert manner. Once a moderator enables 'moderator on', he/she can continue to submit stories with tags till he/she chooses to switch back to 'moderator off'. The users are also shown the updates for the stories submitted by them that are then unpublished as a personalised engagement mechanism. This feature also helps to build accountability in the organisation by enabling users to contact the staff if their story has been left unattended for multiple days.
